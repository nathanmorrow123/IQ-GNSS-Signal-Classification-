Abstractâ€”This project focuses on the development
and implementation of a machine learning pipeline
to classify signal jamming types based on complex
IQ (In-phase and Quadrature) signal data. The pri-
mary objective is to accurately identify various jam-
ming categories using convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The IQ data, stored in .mat files, is first
preprocessed and converted into TFRecord format for
efficient handling by TensorFlow. Labels, representing
different jamming categories, are encoded for the
classification task.
